# quiz-game
This is a tool that could be used in your terminal to help you study!
This is essentially just code that I made up to study for my MIS200 Finals here at Drexel University,
It is supposed to "replicate" quizlet's test cards feature but in the terminal, I will try to adapt a GUI in the future or perhaps adopt react for the future!


## Prerequisites :
Be sure to have Python installed!
